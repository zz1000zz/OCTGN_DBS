# DBS Patch for OCTGN
This is code repository for a project designed to allow people to play the Dragon Ball Z CCG published by Panini (and maintained by fans) on a program named OCTGN.

## Project Structure
More details will be added in the future. For now, the top folder is the "game package" with the definition.xml file being the primary file for the patch. The scripts/ subfolder has all the Python code that runs during matches, and the set/ subfolder has all the card information for the game.
